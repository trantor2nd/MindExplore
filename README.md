## Overview

This work builds upon the foundation established by [iDP3](https://github.com/YanjieZe/Improved-3D-Diffusion-Policy), and we express our sincere appreciation to the authors for making their implementation publicly available. We also acknowledge the use of the ms-swift framework during training, which provided essential support for the development and evaluation of our approach.
